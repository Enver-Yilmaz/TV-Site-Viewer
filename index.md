# TVML Viewer

TVML Viewer lets you store TVML files on any standard web server and then access them from your AppleTV, without writing any JavaScript or creating a separate application.  It's analogous to useing a standard web browser to access static web sites, but with TVML instead of HTML.

To make more than a simple "single page" application, you'll need to use some of the custom elements or attributes that TVML Viewer defines.  If you add an "href" attribute to any selectable element (like "button" or "listItemLockup"), then "selecting" it will navigate to the page, like an "a" in HTML.
