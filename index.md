# TV Site Viewer

TV Site Viewer lets you store TVML files on any standard web server
and then access them from your AppleTV, without writing any JavaScript
or creating a separate application.  It's analogous to useing a
standard web browser to access static web sites, but with TVML instead
of HTML.

To make more than a simple "single page" application, you'll need to
use some of the custom elements or attributes that TVML Viewer
defines.  If you add an "href" attribute to any selectable element
(like "button" or "listItemLockup"), then "selecting" it will navigate
to the page, like an "a" in HTML.

For support, including bug reports and feature requests, please open
an issue via [the github-hosted issue
tracker](https://github.com/dfjdejulio/TV-Site-Viewer/issues).

For more in-depth documentation, including information on how to host
content that will work with the app, consult [the github-hosted
wiki](https://github.com/dfjdejulio/TV-Site-Viewer/wiki).
